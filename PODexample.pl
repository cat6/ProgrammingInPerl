=head1 Survival Horror

Survival horror is a subgenre video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival 
of the character and trying to scare the player(s). Although combat can be a part of the gameplay,
the player is made to feel less powerful than in typical action games, because of limited ammunition,
health, speed, or other limitations. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the
path to new areas, and solve puzzles at certain locations. Games make use of strong horror themes,
and the player is often challenged to navigate dark maze-like environments, and react to unexpected
attacks from enemies.
